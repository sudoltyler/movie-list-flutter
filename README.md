# Movie List Flutter Application - *Fall 2022*
This Flutter application is a list of different movies and grenres,
somewhat like browsing Netflix. A scrollable list divides movies by 
genre, displaying a movie poster which is actionable by short or long press. 
On short press, a new screen is opened displaying the full movie image,
on click the IMDB page for that movie is launched. On long press, a drop down menu
appears with options to view movie info, open the movie's Wikipedia page, or
open the movie's IMDB page.
